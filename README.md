1. This folder includes a computer-model of E.Coli with a detailed deterministic mechanism 
for DNA replication briefly discussed in 

Atlas, J.C., Nikolaev, E.V., Browning, S.T., and Shuler M.L. [2008], 
“Incorporating Genome-Wide DNA Sequence Information into a Dynamic Whole-Cell Model of Escherichia coli: Application to DNA Replication, ” IET Systems Biology 2(5), 369 - 382

2. The oragnization of the folder is as follows.
drivers  - test drivers
model    - the model modules 
routines - auxiliary models
